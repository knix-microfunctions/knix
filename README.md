# Overview

**KNIX MicroFunctions** is an open source serverless computing platform for Knative as well as bare metal or virtual machine-based environments.
It combines container-based resource isolation with a light-weight process-based execution model that significantly improves resource efficiency and decreases the function startup overhead.


Compared with existing serverless computing platforms, **KNIX MicroFunctions** has the following advantages:

* Low function startup latency & high resource efficiency
* Fast locality-aware storage access
* Python and Java function runtimes
* Workflow support and compatibility with [Amazon States Language (ASL)](https://states-language.net/spec.html)
* Support for long-running functions for continuous data processing applications
* Powerful web UI, SDK and CLI for effective serverless application development

# Installation

This section covers installing KNIX.

### Installing KNIX MicroFunctions on Kubernetes

KNIX can be installed using helm charts, assuming you have a Kubernetes cluster and Knative running.

Please refer to the Helm package deployment [README](deploy/helm/microfunctions/README.md).

### Installing KNIX MicroFunctions on Bare Metal or Virtual Machines

KNIX MicroFunctions can also be installed using Ansible playbooks on bare metal or virtual machines. You'll need a user with sudo access.

Please refer to the installation [README](deploy/ansible/README.md).
