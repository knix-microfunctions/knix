# Overview

**KNIX MicroFunctions** is an open source serverless computing platform for Knative as well as bare metal or virtual machine-based environments.
It combines container-based resource isolation with a light-weight process-based execution model that significantly improves resource efficiency and decreases the function startup overhead.


Compared with existing serverless computing platforms, **KNIX MicroFunctions** has the following advantages:

* Low function startup latency & high resource efficiency
* Fast locality-aware storage access
* Python and Java function runtimes
* Workflow support and compatibility with Amazon States Language (ASL)
* Support for long-running functions for continuous data processing applications
* Powerful web UI, SDK and CLI for effective serverless application development

# Installation

This section covers installing KNIX.

### Installing KNIX MicroFunctions on Kubernetes

To install KNIX, youâ€™ll need a running Kubernetes cluster with Knative and root privileges to install KNIX into its own namespace. In particular, KNIX has been tested with the following:

* [Kubernetes:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) version 1.17.5 with storage class for persistent volume claims
* [Helm:](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) version 3.1.2
* [Knative:](https://knative.dev) version 0.13.0

KNIX can be installed using helm charts. Assuming you have a Kubernetes cluster and Knative running, simply run the following command:

```bash
# Install KNIX
# This assumes that you do not have a KNIX deployment yet.
helm install --name mfn1 <helm-chart-url>
```
To remove the deployment named mfn1:

```bash
helm delete --purge mfn1
```
A namespace can be chosen with --namespace my-ns. The --debug option will provide detailed output of what is being deployed.

### Installing KNIX MicroFunctions on Bare Metal or Virtual Machines

KNIX MicroFunctions can also be installed using Ansible playbooks on bare metal or virtual machines. You'll need a user with sudo access.

Please refer to the installation [README](deploy/ansible/README.md).

### Connecting to the KNIX web GUI to create functions and workflows
Nginx is exposed through the Service nx- (e.g. nx-mfn-test) by default on port 20080 (optionally, nginx can be configured with an SSL port).
There's no default Ingress created.
