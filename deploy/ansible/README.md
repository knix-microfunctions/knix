# KNIX ansible installation

To setup KNIX on localhost, or a single remote host, or a cluster of hosts
(Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9 as target machines)

## Prerequisites: on host machine

1. Install ansible on host machine

    <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html>

2. Install dependencies required by ansible

    ```bash
    sudo pip install netaddr
    ```

## Prerequisites: on target machines

1. You can ssh into the target machines/VMs without a password. If not then run (on host machine):

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa your-username@your-target-hostname
    ```

2. The login user (in step 1) on the target machines has been added to the sudoer group

3. Appropriate proxies (/etc/profile, /etc/bash.bashrc, and /etc/apt/apt.conf) are set on target machines

4. `python3`, `python3-dev`, `python3-pip` are installed on each of the target machines

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
    ```

5. docker-ce is installed on target machines

    * Install docker-ce:
    <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>
    <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/>

    * Enable sudo-less access to docker commands - add remote user to the docker group

        ```bash
        sudo usermod -a -G docker your-username
        #newgrp docker (if you don't want to log out and in to activate the change to group)
        ```

    * Set docker proxies by updating `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf`

6. Hostname of the target machine resolves to the correct IP.

7. Remove any old installation of KNIX

    ```bash
    cd /opt/knix
    ./stop-all.sh
    ./purge-riak.sh
    cd ..
    sudo rm -rf knix
    ```

## Installation Steps (to be executed on host machine)

1. Create an `ansible.cfg` file

    ``` bash
    mv ansible.cfg.sample ansible.cfg
    ```

2. Create an `inventory.cfg`

    ```bash
    mv inventory.cfg.sample inventory.cfg
    ```

    * For a localhost setup

        ```bash
        ./local_inventory.sh
        ```

    * For a remote host setup (single host or cluster)

        ```bash
        vi inventory.cfg

        # For a single remote host installation, the hostname should be added to all groups.

        # For a cluster of hosts (preferably 3 or more), all host names must be added to [riak] group.
        #  Only one host name (referred to as the <frontend-hostname>) should be added for other groups [elasticsearch], [management], [frontend], and [nginx].
        ```

3. Update `settings.json`
    * `mfn_server_installation_folder`: folder where KNIX will be installed
    * `start_at_boot`: whether KNIX services should be started at system start up
    * `riak_leveldb_maximum_memory`: total memory (in bytes) assigned to each Riak storage node's LevelDB backend
    * `nginx_http_listen_port`: http port the ngix server, serving the KNIX GUI, will listen on
    * `nginx_https_listen_port`: https port the ngix server, serving the KNIX GUI, will listen on
    * `management_service_exposed_port`: http port management service of KNIX will listen on

4. Checks connectivity to target machines and collects & cache facts about the remote machines

    ```bash
    ansible all -m setup
    ```

5. Run the installation script: (it will ask for SUDO password on the target machine)

    ```bash
    make
    ```

6. After installation, open a browser and access `http://<frontend-hostname>:<nginx_http_listen_port>/`
