# KNIX ansible installation

Setup KNIX on localhost, or a single remote host, or a cluster of hosts.
Tested on the following operating systems on the target machines: 
- Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04
- Xubuntu 18.04, 20.04
- Debian 9

## Prerequisites: on host machine

1. Install dependencies required by ansible

    ```bash
    # for python2
    sudo pip install netaddr
    # for python3
    sudo pip3 install netaddr
    # OR
    sudo apt install python-netaddr
    ```
2. Install ansible on host machine

    <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html>


3. You should be able to ssh into the target machines/VMs without a password. If not then run (on host machine):

    ```bash
    # if not installed yet
    sudo apt-get install ssh
    ssh-keygen
    # you must ensure the target machine has ssh server installed already (see below)
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa your-username@your-target-hostname
    ```

## Prerequisites: on target machines

1. Ensure the ssh server is installed

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ssh
    ```

2. The login user (in step 1) on the target machines should be added to the sudoer group

3. Appropriate proxies (/etc/profile, /etc/bash.bashrc, and /etc/apt/apt.conf) should be set on target machines

4. Appropriate packages should be installed on target machines:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
    # install docker-ce
    #<https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>
    #<https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/>
    # activate sudo-less access to docker commands
    sudo usermod -a -G docker your-username
    #if you don't want to log out and in to activate the change to group
    newgrp docker
    # set docker proxies by updating `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf`
    sudo apt-get install rustc
    ```

5. Ensure that the hostname of the target machine resolves to the correct IP.

6. Remove any old installation of KNIX

    ```bash
    cd /opt/knix
    ./stop-all.sh
    ./purge-riak.sh
    cd ..
    sudo rm -rf knix
    ```

## Installation Steps (to be executed on host machine)

1. Create an `ansible.cfg` file

    ``` bash
    mv ansible.cfg.sample ansible.cfg
    ```

2. Create an `inventory.cfg`

    ```bash
    mv inventory.cfg.sample inventory.cfg
    ```

    * For a localhost setup

        ```bash
        ./local_inventory.sh
        ```

    * For a remote host setup (single host or cluster)

        ```bash
        vi inventory.cfg

        # For a single remote host installation, the hostname should be added to all groups.

        # For a cluster of hosts (preferably 3 or more), all host names must be added to [riak] group.
        # [nginx] and [elasticsearch] group should contain a single host.
        # At least one host should be in [management] and [triggers_frontend] group.
        ```

3. Update `settings.json`
    * `mfn_server_installation_folder`: folder where KNIX will be installed
    * `start_at_boot`: whether KNIX services should be started at system start up
    * `riak_leveldb_maximum_memory`: total memory (in bytes) assigned to each Riak storage node's LevelDB backend
    * `nginx_http_listen_port`: http port the ngix server, serving the KNIX GUI, will listen on
    * `nginx_https_listen_port`: https port the ngix server, serving the KNIX GUI, will listen on
    * `management_service_exposed_port`: http port management service of KNIX will listen on

4. Checks connectivity to target machines and collects & cache facts about the remote machines

    ```bash
    ansible all -m setup
    ```

5. Run the installation script: (it will ask for SUDO password on the target machine)

    ```bash
    make
    ```
6. Check *.log files for any errors

7. After installation, open a browser and access `http://<nginx-hostname>:<nginx_http_listen_port>/`
